<h2>whoami</h2>
&nbsp;
With over 20 years of rockin' experience as a technologist, I've worn multiple hats throughout my career journey, jamming as a System Analyst, Support Engineer, Application Engineer, Web Developer, Agile Scrum Master, and Global IT Manager. But my true groove lies in the realms of Vulnerability Management and Penetration Testing, where I've honed my skills to navigate the wildest technological landscapes. I'm not just about tech, though. I bring some serious swagger to the table with my stellar interpersonal communication skills, making collaboration in highly groovy environments a breeze. As a devoted advocate of Security/DevSecOps, I'm all about fortifying those digital defenses. Leading teams and rocking Scrum/Agile methodologies, I effortlessly riff on analytical problem-solving, delivering epic outcomes. I'm constantly amp'd up for continuous growth and learning, keeping me at the cutting edge of the latest tech trends.
