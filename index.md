# 2020 Goals & Aspirations
&nbsp; &nbsp;
 *“Disruptive technologies are fundamentally expanding the 'Art of the Possible'; reshaping the solution provider ecosystem with a new hierarchy of winners and losers and discombobulating expectations of how and by whom risk and security should be managed and led.”  — Thornton May, IT Futurist, at SecureWorld Charlotte*
&nbsp; &nbsp;
In 2020 I'm setting my focus on infosec/cybersecurity. To that end, I am currently knee-deep in an [Ethical Hacking](https://www.udemy.com/course/practical-ethical-hacking/){:target="_blank"} course created by the talented Heat Adams, and I am having a blast practicing on [Hack The Box](https://github.com/AlexPerucchini/Hack-The-Box){:target="_blank"} - A great way to learn and perfect the pentesting chops. I'm also looking into a couple of professional certifications, starting with the [OSCP](https://www.offensive-security.com/pwk-oscp/){:target="_blank"}, and the [eCCPT](https://www.elearnsecurity.com/certification/ecpptv2/){:target="_blank"} shortly thereafter. All-in-all a rather ambitious plan that should keep me busy in 2020/2021... *"Stay thirsty my friends.”*
