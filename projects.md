### [Hangman](https://github.com/AlexPerucchini/hackingwithswift/tree/master/Hangman-Milestone03/HangMan)

This is my take on the classic HangMan game. Swift 4, Codable, DispatchQueue, and string interpolation.

### [Whack the Penguin](https://github.com/AlexPerucchini/hackingwithswift/tree/master/Whack-Pinguin-Project14) 
This was a milestone SpriteKit Swift 4 project part of the "100 Days of Swift" course. Featuring node masking, SKAction, GCD and more. No actual penguins were armed in the making of this game.
