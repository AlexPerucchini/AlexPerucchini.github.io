<p> 
As a solution-focused IT professional with 20+ years of experience, I am excited to utilize my analytical, technical, and problem-solving abilities to overcome technical challenges on a daily basis. The past few years in an IT leadership a role have re-ignited my passion for the current evolution of technology, and what exciting innovations the next few years will bring.
 
In 2022, my resolve is to deepen my skillsets and foundational knowledge in the DevSecops/SRE/Cloud Architecture space. Leadership, site reliability, automation and security are just a few things that drive my passion - I strive to incorporate those principles with any IT team that I work with and lead.
 
Small, effective and iterative improvements should be the motto for everyone and for any aspects of our lives. Never stop learning and growing friends!</p>
