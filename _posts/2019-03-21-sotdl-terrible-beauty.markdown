I took a brief detour from my current Lion & Dragon reading to garner gaming ideas about the Fae kingdoms for a possible Dark Albion campaign. Lucky for me I had the excellent Terrible Beauty (by Robert Schwalb), a Shadow of the Demon Lord (SotDL) supplement, waiting for me on the bookshelf. Let’s explore the contents shall we?

The pitch from the publisher… 
“ Terrible Beauty presents tools for players and Game Masters to introduce faerie stories, mechanics, and themes into Shadow of the Demon Lord campaigns. Inside, you’ll find:
* The elf, hobgoblin, and pixie ancestries.
* An assortment of new paths such as the Avowed expert path and the eternal guardian and troll hunter master paths.
* The Fey tradition, and new spells for existing traditions.
* Overviews of several sample faerie kingdoms.
* New relics such as the Vorpal Sword and a new enchanted object table.
* New creatures ranging from the fair nymph to the foul jabberwock.
* A complete adventure for expert characters."

I have run a SotDL mini story arc for my players in the past, and it is a great system that I really enjoy. So, does Terrible Beauty deliver? The answer is a resounding yes!

The first few sections offer a quick background on the Fae worlds, creating Fae creatures are next, and followed by the expert paths for character advancement. The Faerie background tables and interesting things are worth the price of admission alone, but the master paths filled with potential NPCs materials really get the imagination working. A small list of unique magic spells rounds this section nicely.

Next is a bit on the lands of the Fae. Here again you will find a full complementary setting for Dark Albion for an easy to lift to any existing campaign. Pages 28-29 contain a great section of tables, interesting characters, strange sights, and weird events, that will provide tons of random spicy and exotic flavors to your Fae lands. The rest of the section dives into the Fae lands of Alfheim, The Nameless City, Elysium and the Midnight Lands, all truly imaginative locales. 

The Creature of the Faeries section brings a good assortment of varied powered Faerie baddies to life.  One of my favorites is the Bean-Nighe, horrid Fae creatures designed to bring nightmares to life and defoul your players. A few of the SotDL strong points are, the concise monster description, stats-block and special attack options, all features that make running this game very special.

Finally, the “My Father Left Forever” expert path adventure, ties all of the elements found in this book. I have not run the adventure yet, but it appears to be spot-on with the horror and weird elements that Shadow of the Demon Lord does really well.  The art, the writing, and the book design are all solid. Terrible Beauty is a highly recommended supplement for any game system.
