"You can mass-produce hardware; you cannot mass-produce software; you cannot mass-produce the human mind."
— Michio Kaku

I am a passionate technologist with over twenty years of experience in the Information Technology field. In my career I was able to wear many hats, System Analyst, Support Engineer, Application Engineer, Web Developer, and Global IT Manager. Some of my key competencies include:

* Architecture and implementation of Azure Cloud solutions
* Strong interpersonal communication skills and proven experience managing teams in a geographical disperse and collaborative organization
* Highly proficient in Scrum, Agile and project management methodologies 
* Strong analytical and problem solving skills; ability to provide “hands on” technical support and analysis

Software development is one of my passions, and the past few years I started developing side coding projects to satisfy both my curiosity and my thirst for knowledge. I have developed applications and scripts in Ruby/Rails, Powershell and now Swift.

The Swift language has matured significantly in the past few years, and now it is poised to impact a lot of domains, from mobile development to server-side scripting. I love Swift because it embodies a lot of the best features of other well loved languages like Ruby, Haskel, and C++. Apple thinks Swift is the future, and based on my experience I totally agree. 

A personal goal is to go deeper with the language and develop applications using all of the tools available from the iOS platform. Dream, design and build is a motto that I will continue to carry forward… “Stay thirsty my friends.”
